## Project Title
Automating Excel Dashboard with VBA Macros

In this project, we create Excel dashboard to keep track of the performance of the organization.

The Excel dashboards are macro enable with VBA scripts that execute embedded SQL queries to spool data to the different sheets of the workbook dashboards. The VBA scripts create connections to the company's SQL Server Databases for data spooling.
